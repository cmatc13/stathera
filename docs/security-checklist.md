# Stathera API Security Checklist

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Stathera API to protect against OWASP API Security Top 10 risks and other common security threats. It serves as a guide for developers to maintain and enhance the security of the application.

## OWASP API Security Top 10 Protections

### 1. Broken Object Level Authorization
- ✅ Implemented object-level access control middleware

- ✅ Resource ownership verification in handlers

### 2. Broken User Authentication
- ✅ JWT-based authentication with proper secret management
- ✅ API key authentication as an alternative
- ✅ Brute force protection with login attempt tracking
- ✅ Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- ✅ Password hashing using bcrypt with high cost factor
- ✅ Token expiration and renewal mechanisms

### 3. Excessive Data Exposure
- ✅ Response sanitization middleware
- ✅ Structured API responses with controlled data exposure
- ✅ No sensitive data in error messages
- ✅ Private keys never returned in responses (except for demo purposes)

### 4. Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
- ✅ IP-based rate limiting
- ✅ User-based rate limiting
- ✅ Path-specific rate limiting
- ✅ Retry-After headers for rate-limited responses

### 5. Broken Function Level Authorization
- ✅ Role-based middleware for admin routes
- ✅ Permission-based access control
- ✅ JWT claims validation for role verification

### 6. Mass Assignment
- ✅ Explicit request struct definitions
- ✅ Manual field mapping from requests to domain objects
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

### 7. Security Misconfiguration
- ✅ Secure HTTP headers
- ✅ Content Security Policy
- ✅ CORS configuration with allowed origins
- ✅ Error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- ✅ Proper TLS configuration (assumed in production)

### 8. Injection
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection protection
- ✅ XSS protection
- ✅ Content-Type validation

### 9. Improper Assets Management
- ✅ API versioning
- ✅ Structured logging of all API access
- ✅ Health checks for all dependencies
- ✅ Metrics collection for monitoring

### 10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
- ✅ Structured logging with appropriate log levels
- ✅ Request ID tracking
- ✅ Detailed error logging
- ✅ Security event logging (auth failures, rate limit hits, etc.)
- ✅ Metrics for monitoring and alerting

## Additional Security Measures

### CSRF Protection
- ✅ CSRF token generation and validation
- ✅ CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- ✅ Exemptions for API key authenticated requests

### Secure Headers
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY
- ✅ X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- ✅ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- ✅ Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
- ✅ Content-Security-Policy

### API Key Security
- ✅ Secure API key generation
- ✅ API key hashing for storage
- ✅ Permission-based API key validation

### Error Handling
- ✅ Consistent error responses
- ✅ No sensitive information in error messages
- ✅ Appropriate HTTP status codes
- ✅ Error metrics collection

### Input Validation
- ✅ Request validation middleware
- ✅ Content-Type validation
- ✅ Parameter sanitization
- ✅ Length and character set restrictions

## Security Best Practices for Developers

### Authentication & Authorization
1. **Always verify authentication** before processing requests
2. **Check authorization** for every resource access
3. **Never trust client input** without validation
4. **Use the security middleware** provided in the application
5. **Keep JWT secrets secure** and rotate them periodically

### Input Handling
1. **Validate all input** using the provided validation middleware
2. **Sanitize input** to prevent injection attacks
3. **Use explicit request structs** to control what data is accepted
4. **Validate content types** for all endpoints that accept data

### Response Handling
1. **Use the standard Response struct** for all API responses
2. **Never expose sensitive data** in responses
3. **Apply response sanitization** where appropriate
4. **Set appropriate status codes** for different scenarios

### Error Handling
1. **Use the renderError method** for consistent error responses
2. **Log errors appropriately** with context
3. **Don't expose internal details** in error messages
4. **Record error metrics** for monitoring

### Logging & Monitoring
1. **Log security events** with appropriate severity
2. **Include request IDs** in all logs for correlation
3. **Monitor rate limit hits** and authentication failures
4. **Set up alerts** for suspicious activity

## Security Testing

### Regular Security Testing
1. **Perform regular security audits** of the codebase
2. **Run automated security scans** as part of CI/CD
3. **Conduct penetration testing** periodically
4. **Review dependencies** for security vulnerabilities

### Common Test Scenarios
1. **Authentication bypass** attempts
2. **Authorization bypass** attempts
3. **Injection attacks** (SQL, NoSQL, Command)
4. **XSS attacks** in any user-provided content
5. **CSRF attacks** on state-changing endpoints
6. **Rate limiting effectiveness**
7. **Brute force protection**

## Security Incident Response

### In Case of a Security Incident
1. **Isolate affected systems** to prevent further damage
2. **Analyze logs** to understand the scope and impact
3. **Fix vulnerabilities** that led to the incident
4. **Rotate compromised secrets** (JWT secrets, API keys)
5. **Document the incident** and update security measures

## Security Configuration

### Environment-Specific Security Settings
1. **Development**: Less restrictive for easier debugging
2. **Testing**: Similar to production for accurate testing
3. **Production**: Most restrictive with all security measures enabled

### Critical Security Parameters
1. **JWT Secret**: Must be strong and unique per environment
2. **CORS Settings**: Restrict to known origins in production
3. **Rate Limits**: Adjust based on expected traffic
4. **Logging Level**: Info or warn in production, never debug

## Maintaining Security

### Regular Updates
1. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch security vulnerabilities
2. **Review security measures** against evolving threats
3. **Update this checklist** as new security measures are implemented

### Security Review Process
1. **Code review** with security focus for all changes
2. **Security testing** for new features
3. **Regular security audits** of the entire application
4. **Threat modeling** for significant architectural changes

## Conclusion

Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time implementation. By following this checklist and continuously improving our security measures, we can maintain a robust and secure API that protects our users' data and maintains their trust.

Remember: Security is everyone's responsibility. If you notice a potential security issue, report it immediately to the security team.
